#Introduction To Programming

---

##What Is Programming

__Programming__ is the task of writing instructions in a language that the computer can understand.

---

##What is a Program

A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do

---

##Becoming A Programmer

It isn't about the programming language, it's about changing how you think.

We have to understand how the computer thinks so we can adjust our own thinking.

---

##How Computers 'Think'

The don't! They are just really good at following instructions.

A computer can't solve a problem that you don't know how to solve already.

--

##They also don't know how you think

Computers are like those magic genies that grant the exact wish you ask for.<br/><br/>

If you don't give the right instructions, you end up dying under a million dollars worth of pennies.

---

##Pseudo Code

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.

Note:
We will talk about algorithms later.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,
If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door
This semester we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a programâ€¦
